                            Dear Voter,
                        </p>
                        <p class="manifesto">
                            It has been a privilege for me to be a Minister for Cork over the past 5 years. I know that they have been difficult years for many people and families. Through your resilience and hard work Cork is now moving in the right direction
                        </p>
                        <p class="manifesto">
                            We are creating jobs, attracting strategic investments and seeing real economic growth. There are 16,000 more people at work in Cork today than five years ago. That progress has been hard earned.
                        </p>
                        <p class="manifesto">
                            As your Minister I’ve tried to prioritise Cork in every way possible: new schools, youth centres, health services, the Events Centre, Páirc Uí Chaoimh, city centre renewal, new roads like the N28 and Dunkettle Interchange, Cork Harbour’s transformation, flood defences, new routes at Cork Airport, FDI jobs, supports for local business and a lot more. We still have much to do but the future is bright if we keep the recovery going!
                        </p>
                        <p class="manifesto">
                            I am determined to never allow our country go back to the politics of easy choices and devastating consequences - boom and bust - we’re never going back to that!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                    <div class="manifesto-container">
                        <p class="manifesto">
                            My commitment is to keep this hard earned recovery going and deliver the benefits to every citizen. That means increased investment in housing, healthcare, education, disability supports and other public services. That means supporting older people and pensioners. That means combating poverty and inequality in society. That means a decent job for everyone.
                        </p>
                        <p class="manifesto">
                            Fine Gael’s promise is clear: to prioritise Job creation, to ensure that work always pays and to use the fruits of economic growth to fund better and fairer public services for everyone.
                        </p>
                        <p class="manifesto">
                            I am ambitious for the region and I want to keep the focus on Cork. A vote for me is a vote for Cork.
                        </p>
                        <p class="manifesto">
                            Thank you for your continued support.
